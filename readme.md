# My Portfolio Blog

This project was created as a simple easy to use resume website with a blog with specific emphasis on using a black background which is actually a personal preference while also ensuring cross platform compatibility for the blog readers. It was built using flask which makes it very light weight in fact my personal version [Akinsola Adefolahan](https://www.adefolahanakinsola.com) is hosted on a 1gb ram instance.

:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it motivates us a lot!
